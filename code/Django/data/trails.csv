He resolved to seek asylum with his ally, O'Rourke of Breifne, and so he gathered his entire clan and set out on a forced march through hostile territory in an attempt to reach O'Rourke's lands in what is today County Leitrim, 500 kilometres to the north. A thousand in all set out, and after many skirmishes with enemies and many severe hardships in the winter weather, only fifteen made it to Leitrim. The terrible journey has become one of Ireland's great epics, and the Ballyhoura Way was laid out along part of the route O'Sullivan took with his clan all those years ago, from St John's Bridge to Limerick Junction. The route crosses four upland stretches, one long one over the Ballyhoura Mountains (highest point Seefin, at 510 metres), two short ones over Benyvoughella Hill and Slievereagh, and then a long traverse on the southern flanks of the Slievenamuck ridge, overlooking the beautiful Glen of Aherlow. The aggregate ascent over the route is just over 1700m, and apart from a few short steep sections there are no significant climbs. Along the way walkers might want to linger at the great Norman castle at Liscarroll, in the pretty villages of Kilfinane, Ballyorgan, Ballylanders and Galbally, or the storied town of Tipperary. The terrain consists mainly of tarmac roads, forestry tracks, and open moorland and field paths. Some of the road sections are busy and should be used with care: some of the upland sections can be very wet. There are not many options for overnight accommodation along the route.

Quite remote, it has remained perhaps the most unspoilt part of the south west region, and like the peninsulas to the north, is a magical world of mountains and lakes surrounded by a picturesque seacoast. The main industries are farming and fishing, with the latter being based in the port of Castletownbere. The Beara Way was established by a local voluntary group in the early 1990s as a co-operative involving upwards of four hundred landowners to augment the revenues coming from a declining fishing industry through tourism. It is a 206km circular route through magnificently rugged mountain and seacoast scenery which frequently passes by rich evidence of a heavily populated prehistoric past in the form of standing stones and burial monuments. There are also many fine villages, such as Allihies and Eyries, along the route. Terrain consists of mainly quiet tarmac roads, bog roads, cliff and woodland paths and open moorland, some sections of which can be quite rough and remote. The total aggregate ascent is nearly 5300m over the whole route and includes some short but steep climbs. Availability of overnight accommodation is generally good along the route although some of the longer stretches between villages may require careful planning. A loop of the route circumnavigates Bere Island with its great forts, and a spur takes you out (by an exciting trip on Ireland's only cable-car) to sparsely inhabited Dursey Island.",https://www.sportireland.ie/outdoors/walking/trails/beara-way,"Dogs are not permitted

The Croagh Patrick Heritage Trail is a 61 km linear walking route that extends from the village of Balla in County Mayo, an early Christian monastic site with a broken round tower, to the village of Murrisk, site of a 15th century Augustinian friary, at the foot of the mountain. The route follows parts of an old pilgrim route as it wanders through the rural landscape of west Mayo towards the holy mountain, passing by a rich heritage of monuments and buildings including early churches, holy wells and castles. Walkers may want to linger in the village of Aghagower, a monastic site where they will find a 12th century church and the remains of another round tower, and at the Clogher Heritage Centre which includes a working blacksmith's forge. Also along the route is Brackloon Wood, a rare oakwood, and a survivor from the time when much of Ireland was covered with such trees.

The circular, relatively flat route is named after Errigal mountain (751m), which rises to the east and whose pyramidic, grey-streaked quartzite cone is a presence frequently visible along the route, even from the coastal stretches. It is a richly varied route through landscapes that represent the best in Donegal scenery, including a promenade through moorland just under Errigal, spectacular island-scattered Atlantic sea coast and stretches beside two beautiful lakes, Lough Nacung and Lough Dunlewy. The terrain consists of coastal paths (some rough), forestry tracks, bog roads and mainly quiet public roads. Total aggregate ascent over the entire route is 720m. There are plenty of accommodation options along the route, including the towns of Falcarragh, Derrybeg, Bunbeg and Gweedore, from which there is a 4.5 km connection to another of the Donegal walks, Sli na Rosann, by way of a link that is partly on a busy road.

It is a wonderfully scenic, rock-strewn landscape scattered with more than a hundred lakes, which make it a mecca for anglers. Slí na Rosann brings walkers through this dramatic and often harsh landscape, passing on its way through the town of Dungloe and the villages of Crolly, Maghery and Burtonport. Terrain on the Slí consists mainly of boreens, some open ground which can be very wet, and quiet country roads that rise and fall as they cross open country. There are also, however, some busier roads which carry fast-moving traffic, so care is needed. Some sections of the route, particularly that between Maghery and Crolly are quite remote and little overnight accommodation is available. The total aggregate ascent over the entire route is 770 metres, with no significant climbs. The route connects from the village of Crolly with another of the Donegal walks, Slí an Earagail, by way of a 4.5 km link that is partly on a busy road. There is also a 22 km link from Crovehy on the route, via the village of Doochary, to Slí na Finne with an aggregate ascent of 550 metres: the link is on side roads, forest and bog roads and open moorland, which is often very wet.

The Iveragh contains the Killarney Lakes with their mountainous backgrounds, the most famously picturesque landscapes in Ireland since tourism began in the late eighteen hundreds.

The Kerry Way, at 230km the longest of the Irish Waymarked Trails, is a circular route that circumnavigates the peninsula, starting and finishing in Killarney, and also passing through fine Kerry towns such as Glenbeigh, Caherciveen, Waterville, Sneem and Kenmare. The landscape the route passes through is very varied, from the lakes of Killarney to high and remote mountain moorland: Carrauntoohil and Caher tower over the route west of Black Valley and the return leg passes along the startlingly contrasting semi-tropical, palm-treed south coast. Terrain consists mainly of quiet tarmac roads, open moorland, woodland and field paths and boreens. Some sections of the open moorland can be very isolated, and off-road sections can often be very wet and muddy.

The route touches on the Burren to the north and the broad Shannon Estuary to the south. Terrain on the route consists mainly of quiet tarmac side roads and farm roads with only brief sections on forestry tracks and through fields. Overnight accommodation possibilities are good, but in some areas the only available options are off-route. Aggregate ascent over the whole route is about 1600m, and the highest point the route reaches is just below the summit of the wooded hill of Ben Dash, west of the River Fergus estuary, at 267 metres. The amount of tarmac to be followed is well made up for by the large number of holy wells, killeens, stone forts, castles and ancient churches passed along the way. Walkers may want to linger, in particular, to enjoy the treasury of rich heritage around Dysert O'Dea Castle, where there is a good history and archaeology centre open to the public, and the beautiful Quin Abbey, dating from 1350.",https://www.sportireland.ie/outdoors/walking/trails/mid-clare-way-sli-na-mearacaun,"Harvesting operations on Mid Clare Way in Booltiagh property.

The village of Arigna was the centre of the industry, and the Miner's Way and Historical Trail is a 118km-long figure-of-eight walking route that starts and ends at Arigna. The route is a varied one that manages to touch on three lakes, Lough Allen, Lough Arrow and Lough Key and crosses three low mountain ranges, Corry Mountain, the Curlew Mountains and the Bricklieve Mountains. Other attractions that may tempt walkers to linger along the way include the Arigna Mining Experience, an interpretative centre for the mines and their history, the 12th century Cistercian Boyle Abbey, and Carrowkeel Neolithic cemetery, which consists of fourteen passage graves topped by stone cairns dating from around 3,000 BC. The route is a complex one that requires constant vigilance for waymarks. Many of the entrances to the old network of underground mines remain open on the hillsides around: they are dangerous and should be avoided. The terrain on the route consists mainly of a variety of quiet tarmac roads, paths across fields, open (and often wet) moorland and forestry paths. The aggregate ascent over the entire route is about 2,600 metres. Overnight accommodation is good in the area.

The Sheep's Head Way is 175km length in total. It is made up of the 88km circular walking route beginning in the town of Bantry in County Cork and running out along the north coast of the peninsula to the scenic lighthouse at the very tip before returning along the south side, passing through the pretty villages of Kilcrohane, Ahakista and Durrus, with the extensions to Drimoealgue and Kealkill to the north providing the additional 87km. The narrowness of the peninsula means that you are never far from the glorious Atlantic Ocean when you walk, even when on the outward stretch when you climb to the route's highest point, 300 metres above sea level, on the heathery Seefin ridge. The terrain is very varied, and includes old boreens, open grassy and heathery moorland, field paths, quiet country roads and some short stretches of woodland paths. The aggregate ascent over the whole route is 2460m, which includes a few long ascents. In good weather those who like the uplands can extend the ridge section of the route, or use a number of alternative loops. The remains of an old copper mine, a blow hole, stone circles, standing stones, high cliffs, a Napoleonic signal tower and old churches are some of the varied attractions to be discovered along the way, while careful observance and a lot of patience may be rewarded by the sighting of dolphins and whales off the westernmost tip of the headland. There are also some shorter loop walks connected to the Sheep's Head Way.",https://www.sportireland.ie/outdoors/walking/trails/sheeps-head-way,"From 8th July, due to tree harvesting on the route of the Sheep's Head Way at Barnagowlanes, the section over Mullaghmesha has been temporarily re-routed via the Mealagh Valley Community Centre and Ards, re-joining the route at Kealkil, and the same route will be in place for those travelling in the opposite direction.

They stand alone in Ireland's Central Plain, which means they can be seen for many miles around and the views from their heights are very extensive. The Slieve Bloom Way, a 70 km circuit of the range, crosses high, heathery ridges and dips down into many deep and beautiful glens through which streams flow, hidden landscapes as full of character as they are of stories and legends. The range is heavily forested with modern conifers which lends much of the route good terrain on forestry roads but means long sections have little outlook. Generally terrain consists of forestry tracks, tarmac roads, mostly quiet, and paths beside streams and over open moorland, some of which can be wet and muddy. Apart from in Kinnity, there is no accommodation available on the actual route, but there are towns and villages of considerable character strung around the range, some quite close to the route, that provide overnight accommodation.

The landscape is a typical river valley one of bogs, callows, woods and unspoilt traditional farmland of many tiny fields, and makes for wonderful and varied low-land walking. The terrain consists of a pleasant mix of cross-country paths through fields and woods, quiet side roads and there are a number of stretches along the banks of the river itself. As is common with countryside that has not been agriculturally over-developed, there is a rich heritage of the remains of monuments and buildings of the past to be enjoyed along the route, including ringforts, castles, ancient churches; you can't miss the unique La Tí¨ne Stone, an ovoid boulder of granite richly carved and dating from the Iron Age, close to the route at Castlestrange. To add to the pleasure of this route, the frequent villages provide plenty of opportunities for relaxing along the way. The route can be subject to flooding so please check locally.

It is a place steeped in legend, and the site of the epic saga known as The Cattle Raid of Cooley, which tells of a battle between Queen Meabh of Connacht and the champion Cú Chulainn over the Brown Bull of Cooley, an animal of great size and reputation. Apart from the sagas, plenty of evidence survives of the Cooley's rich historical past in its passage graves, portal tombs and the well-preserved medieval town of Carlingford, where John, the Magna Carta king, had a great castle built. Like all places off the beaten track, the Cooley has an aura of agelessness and has become a popular place to escape to, however briefly, and overnight accommodation options are plentiful.

The focus of the legendary St Patrick's Purgatory, Station Island, was a deep pit in which those who spent a day and a night would allegedly be purged of their sins, experiencing both the torments of the damned and the delights of the blessed. The walk starts at the visitor centre near the pier where boats bring pilgrims across to Station Island. Information about the pilgrimage may be obtained at the centre. At about 1.15km, there is a wooden fingerpost pointing down to the right along a stepped path to St Brigid's Chair, a naturally weathered boulder of banded gneiss. A little further along the route, another sign points to St Daveoc's Chair. Associated with a local hermit, the €˜chair' is partially natural, but seems to have had one or two large blocks added to it, hinting that it may once have been a Bronze Age burial place. This is the point where the modern route joins the old pilgrimage road that would have brought the medieval pilgrims from Templecarne. At 1.75km, a fingerpost points down to St Brigid's Well, marked by a modern metal cross which is festooned €” like the bush above it €” with pilgrims' votive rags. The goal of the pilgrimage is the edge of the lake opposite Saints Island where one can still see the stones that formed the foundation of the wooden bridge that would have brought medieval pilgrims across to Station Island. The path continues full circle to the visitor centre where the walk began.

The DMW has been an objective of the local authorities for close to twenty years and with the formation of the partnership it has been realised.  This project has been achieved through the cooperation of Coillte, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, South Dublin County Council, Dublin City Council and some private landowners.  The Dublin Mountains Way was officially opened from Shankill to Tallaght on 31st October 2010. The entire route from Shankill to Tallaght is now fully waymarked. This route will be classified as one of the national waymarked ways and is waymarked with the standard yellow walking man symbol. The sections where the Wicklow Way and Dublin Mountains Way run alongside is signed with DMW and WW to avoid confusion.

The bog was cut for sod peat by Bord na Móna over several decades with peat supplying the old power station at Portarlington. The remaining cutaway bog was planted with a conifer plantation by Coillte. Industrial peat production ceased in the 1980s. With the lowering of ground levels during peat production, a basin was created in the central area. After peat production ceased, this area flooded permanently after pumps were turned off to empty the basin. The flooded area is now known as Lough Lurgan. 
There is an area of dry grassland and wood on a small hill to the west of Derryounce Lake. This area is known as Nugent’s Hill and maps from the turn of the 20th Century show evidence of human habitation there together with a well and a spring. The well was clearly important in the locality as there are paths leading from it across Derryounce Bog to Portarlington, Monavane and Cushina. Local anglers also confirm the presence of springs in Lough Lurgan. 
Derryounce Lake was formed artificially through the digging of a hollow down to the sand layer below the peat.

The trails enabled the monks, the people of Melleray and others access the mountaineous areas to harvest turf, to herd sheep and to walk long distances across the mountain range.

He resolved to seek asylum with his ally, O'Rourke of Breifne, and so he gathered his entire clan and set out on a forced march through hostile territory in an attempt to reach O'Rourke's lands in what is today County Leitrim, 500 kilometres to the north. A thousand in all set out, and after many skirmishes with enemies and many severe hardships in the winter weather, only fifteen made it to Leitrim. The terrible journey has become one of Ireland's great epics, and the Ballyhoura Way was laid out along part of the route O'Sullivan took with his clan all those years ago, from St John's Bridge to Limerick Junction. The route crosses four upland stretches, one long one over the Ballyhoura Mountains (highest point Seefin, at 510 metres), two short ones over Benyvoughella Hill and Slievereagh, and then a long traverse on the southern flanks of the Slievenamuck ridge, overlooking the beautiful Glen of Aherlow. The aggregate ascent over the route is just over 1700m, and apart from a few short steep sections there are no significant climbs. Along the way walkers might want to linger at the great Norman castle at Liscarroll, in the pretty villages of Kilfinane, Ballyorgan, Ballylanders and Galbally, or the storied town of Tipperary. The terrain consists mainly of tarmac roads, forestry tracks, and open moorland and field paths. Some of the road sections are busy and should be used with care: some of the upland sections can be very wet. There are not many options for overnight accommodation along the route.

As with all waymarked trails, the occassional waymarker can be knocked over or dislodged so always carry a map so that you can confirm that you are following the correct route.

The Suck Valley Way is a circular route that runs up the west side of the Suck from Mount Talbot to the outskirts of the town of Castlerea and returns, with one brief interruption, down the east side, taking in €˜The Nine Friendly Villages', Ballygar, Creggs, Glinsk, Ballymoe, Ballintubber, Dunamon, Castlecoote, Athleague and Mount Talbot. The landscape is a typical river valley one of bogs, callows, woods and unspoilt traditional farmland of many tiny fields, and makes for wonderful and varied low-land walking. The terrain consists of a pleasant mix of cross-country paths through fields and woods, quiet side roads and there are a number of stretches along the banks of the river itself. As is common with countryside that has not been agriculturally over-developed, there is a rich heritage of the remains of monuments and buildings of the past to be enjoyed along the route, including ringforts, castles, ancient churches; you can't miss the unique La Tí¨ne Stone, an ovoid boulder of granite richly carved and dating from the Iron Age, close to the route at Castlestrange. To add to the pleasure of this route, the frequent villages provide plenty of opportunities for relaxing along the way. The route can be subject to flooding so please check locally. See The Suck Valley Way website www.suckvalleywaywalk.ie for more details.

This is followed across isolated bogland at Meenawannia to reach Glenties. From Glenties an enjoyable stretch which includes a very pleasant riverside walk along the Owenea river takes the route to the town of Ardara. Overnight accommodation options in the populated areas are very good. The terrain of the route consists generally of bog roads, open and often wet moorland, and mainly quiet tarmac public roads. In wet or otherwise unsuitable weather it is possible to avoid the open moorland stretch west of Disert by taking an alternative route to Glenties. The aggregate ascent over the route is 1430m, but other than the stretch up onto the pass between Binbane and Cloghmeen Hill, there are no significant climbs.",https://www.sportireland.ie/outdoors/walking/trails/bluestack-way,Please do not bring dogs on any section of the Way which crosses private land.

I measc na nithe is díol spéise do shiúlóiri fanacht ar an mbealach tá Eispéireas Mianadóireachta na hAirgní, ionad léirmhíniúcháin maidir leis na mianaigh agus a stair, Mainistir Cistéirseach na Búille ón 12ú haois, agus reilig Neoiliteach na Ceathrún Caoile, ina bhfuil ceithre thuama pasáiste déag agus cairn chloiche ar a mbarr ó timpeall 3,000 R.Ch. Tá an bealach casta agus ní mór a bheith ag faire amach do mharcanna slí i gcónaí. Tá go leor de na bealaí isteach chuig an seanghréasán de mhianaigh faoi thalamh fós oscailte ar thaobh an chnoic: tá siad contúirteach agus ba chóir iad a sheachaint. Tá an tír-raon comhdhéanta go príomha de bhóithre tarmac ciúine, cosáin a thrasnaíonn páirceanna, móinteach oscailte (a bhíonn fliuch go minic) agus cosáin foraoiseachta.

Apart from the sagas, plenty of evidence survives of the Cooley's rich historical past in its passage graves, portal tombs and the well-preserved medieval town of Carlingford, where John, the Magna Carta king, had a great castle built. Like all places off the beaten track, the Cooley has an aura of agelessness and has become a popular place to escape to, however briefly, and overnight accommodation options are plentiful.

Starting in the famous angler's town of Oughterard on Lough Corrib, it follows the western edge of the lake, one of the longest, and the second largest lake in Ireland, northwards into a magnificent wilderness of mountain and bog to reach civilisation again at the village of Maam Bridge. It was from here that the Scottish engineer Alexander Nimmo planned the modern roads of Connemara in the early 19th century. From Maam Bridge the route crosses the rugged Maumturk Mountains by a pass, at the top of which is Maum Ean, a holy place that has attracted pilgrims since the early Christian period. Descending again into the beautiful Inagh Valley the route passes between the Twelve Bens and the Maumturks, and through a sad landscape that was, before the Great Famine, well populated by cottiers, to reach the shores of Killary Harbour and the picturesque village of Leenane, one of the locations for the movie The Field. Overnight accommodation is limited along the route, so careful planning is necessary. The terrain consists of quiet roads, bog roads, open moorland, forestry tracks, mountain paths and about 3km of timber bog bridge: some parts of the route can be very wet and boggy, particularly after a rainy period, when there is a fast run-off from the Connemara mountains. The total aggregate ascent over the route is about 533m.",https://www.sportireland.ie/outdoors/walking/trails/western-way-galway,"There is an additional 3km between Leenaun and the County Mayo border for those walking both the Galway and Mayo Sections of the Western Way.

The circular, relatively flat route is named after Errigal mountain (751m), which rises to the east and whose pyramidic, grey-streaked quartzite cone is a presence frequently visible along the route, even from the coastal stretches. It is a richly varied route through landscapes that represent the best in Donegal scenery, including a promenade through moorland just under Errigal, spectacular island-scattered Atlantic sea coast and stretches beside two beautiful lakes, Lough Nacung and Lough Dunlewy. The terrain consists of coastal paths (some rough), forestry tracks, bog roads and mainly quiet public roads. Total aggregate ascent over the entire route is 720m.

The main industries are farming and fishing, with the latter being based in the port of Castletownbere. The Beara Way was established by a local voluntary group in the early 1990s as a co-operative involving upwards of four hundred landowners to augment the revenues coming from a declining fishing industry through tourism. It is a 206km circular route through magnificently rugged mountain and seacoast scenery which frequently passes by rich evidence of a heavily populated prehistoric past in the form of standing stones and burial monuments. There are also many fine villages, such as Allihies and Eyries, along the route. Terrain consists of mainly quiet tarmac roads, bog roads, cliff and woodland paths and open moorland, some sections of which can be quite rough and remote. The total aggregate ascent is nearly 5300m over the whole route and includes some short but steep climbs. Availability of overnight accommodation is generally good along the route although some of the longer stretches between villages may require careful planning.

It connects Donegal town with the town of Ardara on the west coast. Along the way the route passes by scenic Lough Eske, and then wends its way across the foothills of the Bluestacks to reach an area called Disert, where there is an ancient mountain graveyard. West of Disert the route goes over rough and remote high moorland terrain between Binbane and Cloghmeen Hill before descending along the Owenroe river to reach a bog road. This is followed across isolated bogland at Meenawannia to reach Glenties. From Glenties an enjoyable stretch which includes a very pleasant riverside walk along the Owenea river takes the route to the town of Ardara. Overnight accommodation options in the populated areas are very good. The terrain of the route consists generally of bog roads, open and often wet moorland, and mainly quiet tarmac public roads. In wet or otherwise unsuitable weather it is possible to avoid the open moorland stretch west of Disert by taking an alternative route to Glenties. The aggregate ascent over the route is 1430m, but other than the stretch up onto the pass between Binbane and Cloghmeen Hill, there are no significant climbs.",https://www.sportireland.ie/outdoors/walking/trails/bluestack-way,Please do not bring dogs on any section of the Way which crosses private land.

It is a wonderfully scenic, rock-strewn landscape scattered with more than a hundred lakes, which make it a mecca for anglers. Slí na Rosann brings walkers through this dramatic and often harsh landscape, passing on its way through the town of Dungloe and the villages of Crolly, Maghery and Burtonport. Terrain on the Slí consists mainly of boreens, some open ground which can be very wet, and quiet country roads that rise and fall as they cross open country. There are also, however, some busier roads which carry fast-moving traffic, so care is needed. Some sections of the route, particularly that between Maghery and Crolly are quite remote and little overnight accommodation is available. The total aggregate ascent over the entire route is 770 metres, with no significant climbs. The route connects from the village of Crolly with another of the Donegal walks, Slí an Earagail, by way of a 4.5 km link that is partly on a busy road. There is also a 22 km link from Crovehy on the route, via the village of Doochary, to Slí na Finne with an aggregate ascent of 550 metres: the link is on side roads, forest and bog roads and open moorland, which is often very wet.
